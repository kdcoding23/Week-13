Promineo Tech's Week 13 assignment was to create a React login form with the following criteria:

- Username and password input fields, an h3 that says Log In, with a border. Style the component using the default generated CSS file.
- A navigation component that contains links styled like a navbar. The links don’t have to go anywhere. Put the Navigation component at the top of the page and the LoginForm in the center of the page.
